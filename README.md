## Insights:
> Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
`MAJOR` is for incompatible API, it means previous version will not be compatible with new MAJOR version
`MINOR` is for adding new backward-compatibility feature. `PATCH` is to fix bugs introduced in backward-compatibility feature.

Tilde Character ~ to use latest PATCH Version
e.g. "~1.2.9" means we can use `1.2.x`
